The add book window is the home window of this application with a full background image. This window consists of the add book form which has the following features:
1. Notifies user when adding a book if all the fields are not filled
2. Notifies with a message box if a book that you are trying to add already exists in the database
3. Provides basic information of what ISBN is in case the user doesn't know
4. A Clear button that lets you clear all the form fields after a book is added to the database successfully 

Following shows the complete working of the *Book Management System Application*
